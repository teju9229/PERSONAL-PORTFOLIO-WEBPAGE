##DESCRIPTION

Personal Portfolio Website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a dynamic and interactive platform designed to showcase an individual's professional identity, technical skills, and achievements. This website acts as an online resume and portfolio, allowing visitors—including recruiters, clients, or collaborators—to explore the creator's profile, projects, certifications, and get in touch easily.

The structure of the portfolio is crafted using **HTML**, with clearly defined sections such as **Home**, **About Me**, **Skills & Experience**, **Projects**, **Certifications**, and **Contact**. The **About Me** section includes a short bio, professional goals, and a profile image, offering a personalized introduction. The **Experience** section outlines job roles, internships, or academic positions held, with timelines and key responsibilities listed clearly for quick reference.

One of the core features is the **Projects** section, where each project is displayed in card format with images, titles, brief descriptions, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories. This provides real-time evidence of skills in action. The **Certifications** section includes recognized credentials from courses, training programs, or bootcamps, often displayed as clickable badges or downloadable PDFs.

**CSS** plays a crucial role in creating a visually appealing, modern design with themes, color schemes, hover effects, and smooth transitions. Responsive design ensures the website looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Parallax backgrounds, subtle animations, and interactive cards give the site a professional and polished look.

**JavaScript** is used to enhance interactivity. It powers features like a responsive navbar toggle, smooth scrolling, image sliders, and a dynamic **contact form** with input validation. The contact form allows visitors to send direct messages by entering their name, email, subject, and message. This form can be connected to email services (like EmailJS) or backend APIs for real-time message delivery.

In addition, JavaScript can be used to add light/dark mode toggles, animated skill bars, or even dynamically load content for better performance. Features like typing effects on the homepage or animated counters for experience stats make the website more engaging.

Overall, a personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a powerful tool for students, developers, designers, or freelancers. It provides a professional online presence, builds credibility, and opens doors to new opportunities by making it easy for others to view your work, qualifications, and connect with you directly.
